Brewery Analysis 

An Analysis of Breweries in the United States

By: David Jimenez, David Alberghini, John Mowry, Spencer Davis, Joey Riebel, & Bailey Taber

Welcome to our analysis on brewery markets! This analysis is subject to further development and has been submitted as a team project to The University of Denver’s Data Analytics Bootcamp. 

For our project, we set out to conduct an analysis on brewery progression over the past decade in the United States. We’ve sourced our initial data from both flat files and API’s. Taxable Sales, Open Brewery DB, and Latitude and Longitudes of US Capitals were all reliable csv files that we pulled from.  GMAPS, US Census Bureau, and Open Weather were all manageable API’s that we pulled relevant information from to execute our analysis. 

Prior to beginning our research, we were curious to analyze where breweries were dispersed throughout the US and what were some of the determining factors behind a brewery’s location. We began our research on a wide scale of the entire US. After doing some nationwide analysis, we pinpointed the top 10 states according to their brewery count. Narrowing down even further, we picked one of the top 10 states for a data sample. We chose to hone-in-on Colorado. By the end, we focused on the correlations of specific demographics to brewery count within different counties in Colorado. 

Within this repository, you will find some of our discoveries.
